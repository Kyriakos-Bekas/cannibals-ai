# Cannibals &amp; Missionaries Problem 

## Introduction

This algorithm was created as a project for the course *Artificial Intelligence* of the Athens University of Economics and business.
The algorithm finds a solution to the **Cannibals &amp; Missionaries** problem.

## Problem Explanation

In the Cannibals &amp; Missionaries problem, 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals want to cross from the left bank of a river to the right bank of the river. However, if the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either bank, the cannibals will eat the missionaries. In this case, our algorithm solves the problem for *n* amount of cannibals and missionaries.

## Algorithm

The problem is solved using the A* Algorithm.
